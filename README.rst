My Emacs setup
==============

This repo contains my Emacs configuration.  I don't really touch this
much; in fact, if you look closely, you'll see I messed it up in 2019
and then committed the mess.  That's how classy my Emacs config is.
Anyway, you probably don't want to use my Emacs setup, but you might
be interested in the `Ansible playbook`_ I use to deploy it onto the
machines I work on.
